# ðŸ“– Sesquipedalian Dictionary
* Technologies used: React, Dictitionary API, Pexels API and Spline
* Web app that allows you to search any word in the English language
* It does not only provide the meaning and phonetics of a word (in audio and writing), but it also shows images related to the search
* To make the app a bit more fun and interactive, I built a 3D owl that moves along with the cursor, using Spliner
